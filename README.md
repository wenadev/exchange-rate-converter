# live exchange-rate-converter [Click here](https://wenadev.github.io/exchange-rate-converter/)

This live exchange rate has two converters: 
- The first converts only from the USD currency to 150 currencies due to the restrictions on the API used.
- The second converts between a limited number of 52 currencies.

The menu components in the webpage are inactive as they were included primarily for aesthetics.

The converter was built alongside two active collaborators as the first project task to continue in the WeJapa Internship 2020 organized by Favour Ori (https://github.com/favourori)
